### 1. Download the App

Visit the release page to get the software package:

[Download TV-Show-Recommender-AI](https://github.com/Zopze/TV-Show-Recommender-AI/releases)

The link will take you to the page with all the available versions. Pick the one that matches your computer system, such as:

- **Windows:** Look for files ending with `.exe`.

  chmod +x [filename].AppImage
  ```

  Then double-click to launch or run it from the terminal.

If you downloaded a compressed file like `.tar.gz`, extract it first before running the app.

- The app will show you recommendations based on your input.
- Try typing multiple shows to refine results.
- Use the AI-generated poster options to view custom images for your picks.
- If you mistype a show, the app’s fuzzy matching will still try to understand and suggest close matches.

## 🔍 How It Works

TV-Show-Recommender-AI uses vectors to represent TV shows. Vectors are lists of numbers that show how similar one show is to another.

- **Embeddings:** The app creates these vectors from show descriptions and metadata.
- **Cosine similarity:** This math formula measures how close two vectors are.
- **Fuzzy matching:** Fixes small input errors and typos so you get good recommendations.
- **AI suggestions:** The app can even come up with new show ideas and posters using OpenAI tools.

You don’t see any of this complexity, but it makes recommendations smarter and more fun.
